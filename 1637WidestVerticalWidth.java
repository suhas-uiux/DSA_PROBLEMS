// Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

// A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

// Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

 

// Example 1:

// â€‹
// Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
